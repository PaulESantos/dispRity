One simple idea would be to get `Claddis::calculate_morphological_distances` to split the matrix by character types into multiple matrices of characters to be treated differently in `dispRity::char.diff` and then combine them separately in `Claddis::calculate_morphological_distances`


```{r}
## Example from Claddis::calculate_morphological_distances
character_dependencies <- matrix(c(8, 7),
  ncol = 2,
  byrow = TRUE, dimnames = list(
    c(),
    c(
      "dependent_character",
      "independent_character"
    )
  )
)

distances <- calculate_morphological_distances(
  cladistic_matrix = day_2016,
  inapplicable_behaviour = "hsj",
  character_dependencies = character_dependencies,
  alpha = 0.5
)






```
